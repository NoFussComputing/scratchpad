This documentation is targeted towards the application users. This section of the documentation specifically targets the UI and how to use each of the applications modules.

Documentation for specific items can be found in the navigation menu to the left of the screen.


### History

Effort is placed upon all database items having a history. The items that specifically track history can be found on the items documentation page under its features heading. The history Module tracks the following:

- What Item Type

- What the change was

- Who made the change

- When the change was made

Once a history entry has been made for an item, no one including a `super_admin` can edit or delete a history entry. The only time a history entry is removed, is when an item is removed from the database.
