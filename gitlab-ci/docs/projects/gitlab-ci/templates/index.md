As part of our Gitlab CI job definitions we also have gitlab-ci.yaml templates that are specifically designed for inclusion and will automagically add the required jobs.

## Docs ToDo

- all templates are in the template folder.

- explain `.gitlab-ci_common.yaml` is for inclusion by all, _suggested._ and will never create jobs, only specify defaults. is also included in all templates

!!! Note
    Docs Still under development
